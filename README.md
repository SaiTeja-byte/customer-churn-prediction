# Customer Churn Prediction [ðŸ”—](https://customer-churn-prediction-shk.streamlit.app/)
A machine learning project to predict customer churn using historical data, with complete preprocessing, modeling, and feature analysis in a single notebook.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Predict whether a customer will discontinue a subscription-based service based on their historical data.

We analyze factors like:
- Usage patterns
- Demographic details
- Subscription duration
- Other important features

The project aims to:
- Build an accurate churn prediction model.
- Identify the most significant factors influencing customer churn.

## Streamlit
I have done a beautiful and lightweight **Streamlit web application** for predicting **customer churn** probability using a machine learning model.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts if a customer will **churn** or **stay**.
- Displays **churn probability (%)** using an attractive **speedometer (gauge meter)**.
- **Custom header** with title and quick access buttons.
- **Beautiful light theme** with dynamic CSS styling.
- **Footer fixed** at the bottom showing copyright.
- **Responsive layout** using Streamlit and Plotly.

## ðŸš€ Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BSHK57/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Open `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`.

4. **Run All Cells**
   - The notebook will guide you through:
     - Data loading
     - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Model training
     - Model evaluation
     - Feature importance analysis

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Strealit.py
   ```
